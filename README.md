This project aims to provide users with an analytical dashboard, built on Streamlit,so they can tell their friends who has the best Quarterback, choose the best player for Fantasy Football, or gambling. 

To begin the project I first needed the data. I went to https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ and found tables which included the schedule, 
touchdown, kicking, receiving, passing, roster. I built programs to webscrape and build dataframes in order for me to save the data into csv files. With the data collected, I was then able to import the csv files into a SQL database for fast query to build the graphs. I'm using Streamlit framework to build a selective dashboard for users to choose which season, team, and table to look at.
